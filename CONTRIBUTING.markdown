# How to contribute

Liferay is developed by its community, including Liferay users, enthusiasts,
employees, customers, partners, and others. Contributions can originate with any
community member, and are highly encouraged. There are several ways in which you
can contribute to Liferay's open source project, including bugfixes, new
features, documentation improvements, translations, and enhancements to existing
features.

To maintain the quality and innovation Liferay has come to be known for, all
changes will be code reviewed by a core set of Liferay project maintainers. All
community contributors are encouraged to get to know and work with the [core
maintainer(s)](http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponents-panel)
for the area in which they are working.

If you have an idea for a new feature, and wish to implement it, follow the
contribution steps outlined in the
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide
found in the `liferay-portal` repository. This guide contains details on how to
contribute to Liferay and additional useful resource links.
